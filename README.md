# News App (MVVM Architecture)

Ensure that you have the required API keys and permissions for accessing network resources. (https://newsapi.org/)
Implement it on the HomePageViewModel.kt

## Dependencies
The project includes the following dependencies:
  - Retrofit: for networking.
  - Gson: for JSON parsing.
  - ViewModel & LiveData: for managing UI-related data.
  - Glide: for image loading.
  - Kotlinx Serialization: for JSON serialization and deserialization.
  - Jetpack Compose: for building the UI.

### The Favourites page is currently under construction. So these dependencies will be used later.
  - Datastore: for storing simple data using key-value pairs.
  - Room: for local database storage.
